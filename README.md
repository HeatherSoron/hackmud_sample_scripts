# What is Hackmud?

Hackmud is a multiplayer online game about hacking, where you can write your own scripts. I'm a player, and here are some sample scripts :).

# How do I use these?

Look in the 'scripts' folder for files ending in '.js'. Copy these files into your game's script directory, and then in-game, run `#up <scriptname>`. You should then be able to use the scripts in-game!

Depending on your platform, your game's script directory can be found in `%APPDATA%\hackmud\<username>\scripts` (Windows), or `~/.config/hackmud/<username>/scripts` (Mac & Linux).

You might want to run `#edit <some_script>` in-game in order to create the directory. Note that #edit has a few platform-specific bugs at the moment, so it can be a good idea to just open scripts directly in an editor of your choice.

# Contributing

I welcome contributions! Couple rules:

* All contributions must be made available under the same license as I have (i.e., public domain, with redundant CC0 and Unlicense)
* No _functional_ lock cracking scripts. I'll accept certain incomplete (non-functional) lock cracking scripts, but not completed ones.
* If you add obvious backdoors, please point them out via a comment ;).

Since this is a multiplayer game and I am pretend-rich, I can offer in-game credits (GC) to people who want to write sample code rather than cracking NPCs or PVPing. Contact me to make arrangements.
